Socket programming in Zig can be incredibly simple when compared with C.  

In this video, I'll dive into creating a simple socket server, sending HTTP 
information, and making the server multi-threaded.

```=html
<div style="position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden">
    <iframe 
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V7Jql_SZ7kY" 
        style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0" 
        allowfullscreen="" 
        title="YouTube Video"
    ></iframe>
</div>
```
