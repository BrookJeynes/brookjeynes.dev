<p>I recently went on my first proper hike/climb with a mate up Mt Ngungun, one of the
beautiful mountains located within the <a href="https://www.aussiebushwalking.com/qld/se-qld/glass-house-mountain-national-park/mt-ngungun">Glass House Mountains, QLD</a>.</p>
<p>During one of my doom scrolling sessions through Instagram, I saw
a video recommending a simple climb up a mountain (Mt Ngungun) that was around a 2 hour
drive from where I lived. I&rsquo;d been trying to get outdoors more and introduce more exercise into
my weekly routine, so I sat and thought to myself &ldquo;hmmm, that sounds fun&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I messaged one of my mates and the conversation pretty much went like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Me: Hey... wanna get up at 3:30am to climb a mountain and see the sun rise?
Him: Sure..
     My bags packed ready
Me: Sweet, pick you up at 4am
</code></pre><p>and the mission was a go, operation: climb Mt Ngungun <em>(original, I know)</em></p>
<h2 id="leading-up-to-the-climb">Leading up to the climb</h2>
<p>Leading up to the climb, I knew in the back of my mind it was going to be somewhat
challenging, whether that be the climb itself or the 2 hour drive and 3:30am wakeup.</p>
<p>So I did what any self respecting man would do.. I bought an energy drink.</p>
<h2 id="the-climb">The Climb</h2>
<p>So here I am, 3:30am in the morning, energy drink in hand, ready to drive to
this mountain.</p>
<p>The drive couldn&rsquo;t have gone any smoother, it was peaceful. Just me,
my favourite tunes, and the windows down, going 100 on the highway.</p>
<p>I picked up my mate and we were off. We arrived at the mountains base around
5:20am and we were ready to start the hike. Despite the heavy rain the night before,
the climb was pretty dry. It did however lead to an intense humidity within the
bush.</p>

<p>Within 30 minutes we had reached the top of Mt Ngungun, and oh my, was that breeze
just what we needed. The sights from 259 meters above were absolutely stunning.</p>

<p>My mate had been smart enough to bring a small tarp for us to sit on. We sat
down to rest and had a small picnic taking in the views.</p>

<p>After about 40 minutes on the top (and a thousand photos taken), we decided it
was time to pack up shop and head to a cafe for a proper breakfast.</p>
<p>On the way down, we passed many people who we&rsquo;d assumed were the locals doing their
morning routine. The thought of being able to wake up before work and see views like
that really excited me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the future has in store for me, but I know it at least involves another
mountain or two.</p>
